# Website for Trash Bin Minecraft Mod

The [Trash Bin Minecraft Mod I created](https://github.com/PekkaAstala/minecraft-mod-trashbin) needed some form of website so the mod loader can query a JSON config file for new versions of the mod and so on.

So I quickly threw together a gatsby-based and surge-hosted "website" with 2 pages and default styles, etc.
